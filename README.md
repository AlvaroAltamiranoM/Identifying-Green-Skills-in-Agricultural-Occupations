# Identifying-Green-Skills-in-Agricultural-Occupations
This project employs string similarity matching using ESCO’s taxonomy and Spacy's medium-sized English language model to identify "green" skills in agriculture occupations in Colombia and Ethiopia.

ESCO taxonomy’s skills-to-occupation matrices map the skills required for various agricultural occupations. CEDEFOP provides two relevant datasets for this matching task: one containing 296 general skills applicable to as many as 3,000 occupations, and another containing 570 green skills. Using cosine similarity coefficients, the model measures the resemblance between these two skill label sets, aiding in the classification of skills as either green or conventional. Notably, without this automation, the alternative would entail the manual comparison of more than 168 thousand skill-label dyads. We classified a conventional skill label as green if its cosine similarity coefficient was greater than or equal to 0.80.
